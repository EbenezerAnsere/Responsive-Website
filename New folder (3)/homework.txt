maybe you just have to copy that functionality into the new project
it is not part of the requirements 

so on this doashboard you show the summary of the all the items you have

he is comming 

he has done some already let him come
i am trying to figuer out something on my code
but later i will come and check what you ha

distinst spell wrong word but i forget

interest percent disort

iterest rate discount thanks i am confused with words


you dont need any of those

just the total numberof items
the total category of the items
total number of the items in stock


so you can show a table with the various items and the quantity
if any of the items has a qty = 0 then maybe the text should be red
if it is between 1 and 20 it should be orange color and if it is 
more than 20 then the color of the text should be green i understand

what do you want

just create a table


so now you can you css to style it the way you want

so you just use css to change the color of the text base on ok 

it means you should be able to add to the list and also delete and also update thank

so he will come and 

because i have not finish it is difficult doing some of the thinks 
unles ifinish and find out how to solve it yes, it is true that this project is hard but i 
am confident that you are able to do the project. And i hope you will be finished the project
